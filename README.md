# GRAVEL

This is my final project at [Ironhack](http://www.ironhack.com) web-development bootcamp.

Two weeks developing our own web app transferring all the knowledge I have acquire the previous 6 weeks.

Project voted one of the top 5 by a jury of industry professionals.

## What's Gravel
This is a **very beta version** of a web app for boulder climbers. 
Written mostly in JavaScript as a Single Page Application and using Rails as an API at the backend, this app allows users 
to photograph boulders, take geographic coordinates and describe a rudimentary path on the sourface.

This app has been my way to learn and develop my very first JS application so be gentle, there should be many errors but 
this is an ongoing work (I hope).
